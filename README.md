A simple R Script used to clean the experimental data I collected during my dissertation.

This would make the data considerably easier to analyse in Jamovi, by ensuring data was relevant and usable.

This script also merged the data from a number of CSV files into one large results file, so the dataset could be treated as one.

The scripit also ensures the results are numeric, so that I didn't run into data type issues when running statistical analyses.
